====================
Vasputil release 4.2
====================

Vasputil is a set of command-line utilities and python libraries designed to
make life with VASP easier. It provides a set of commands to manipulate POSCAR
files.

Available commands via the ``vasputil`` binary are:

poscar2xyz
    Convert a POSCAR file to a xyz format file.
plane2atom 
    Calculate the average distance from a plane to a set of atoms.
plane2layer 
    Calculate the average distance from a plane to a layer.
atomsdistance 
    Calculate the distance between two atoms.
atomsmoved
    Check which atoms have moved from one POSCAR to another.
interpolate
    Interpolate the coordinates between two POSCAR files.
normalize
    Normalize the coordinates in a POSCAR file.
unnormalize
    Unnormalize coordinates in a POSCAR file.
centercell
    Center a cell around a point.
removeatoms
    Remove atoms from a POSCAR file.
kspace2xyz
    Convert a POSCAR file to a xyz file with reciprocal coordinates.
check_nndist
    Check nearest neighbor distances.
scgenerator
    Generate a supercell.
lockatoms
    Lock atom coordinates in a supercell.
xyz2poscar
    Convert a XYZ file to a POSCAR file.
dumpcoords
    Dump cartesian coordinates to stdout.
importcoords
    Read cartesian coordinates from stdin.
dumpatomsase
    Dump atom types and coordinates suitable for importing to Campos ASE.
test
    Run self-tests.

Documentation for each utility is available by running it without any
arguments, e.g. ``vasputil poscar2xyz``.

In addition to the above, vasputil contains some Python scripts, which can be
used directly or as examples of what can be done with the provided python
modules.  These are 

``vasputil_dosplot``
    Plot density-of-states. 

``vasputil_interpolate``
    Wrapper around "vasputil interpolate" for creating many evenly spaced images at once.

``vasputil_zlayers``
    Find layers in z direction and print interlayer distances.

Vasputil is written mostly the Fortran 95 programming language with a few
optional Fortran 2003 features such as command line argument handling, and
should be compilable by any compiler that conforms to said standard.  Vasputil
uses the common GNU autotools based build system, and has been tested with IBM
xlf95, Lahey lf95, Pathscale pathf90, Intel ifort, GNU Fortran (Gfortran), and
Portland pgf90. Parts of vasputil are also written in Python, see below for
requirements.

Vasputil depends on the LAPACK and BLAS libraries. The provided autotools build
system tries to use different platform-specific optimized versions of the BLAS
library; ESSL on IBM, the BLAS that is provided with the Lahey compiler, and
the Portland and Pathscale Makefiles use the AMD ACML library.

To regenerate the Fortran source code documentation (file doc/vasputil.html),
the `robodoc <http://www.xs4all.nl/~rfsber/Robo/>`_ utility is needed. To
regenerate the README.html file, the `rst2html
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/tools.html>`_ utility is needed.
Finally, to regenerate the dependency list, the `makedepf90
<http://personal.inet.fi/private/erikedelmann/makedepf90/>`_ utility is needed.


Quick Installation Instructions
===============================

1)  Unpack the source code.

    ``tar xvzf vasputil-$(VERSION).tar.gz``

2)  Run configure, if necessary with extra flags to specify location of
    libraries not in the default search path, if you want to use some specific
    compiler etc.

    Eg. to use dynamically linked ACML:

    ``./configure LDFLAGS=-L/opt/acml/pathscale64/lib/``

    Statically linked ACML

    ``./configure --with-blas=/opt/acml/pathscale64/lib/libacml.a``

    Use Intel Fortran

    ``./configure FC=ifort``

    Install somewhere not in the default location ($HOME)

    ``./configure --prefix=/usr/local``

    For help, see

    ``./configure --help``

3)  Compile and install.

    ``make && make install``


Python Scripts
==============

To use the python scripts you should add the python library directory to the
PYTHONPATH environment variable. E.g. if you ran configure with the prefix
$HOME (default), then you should have something like 

``export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages``

where X.Y is your python version, in your shell initialization file (e.g.
~/.bash_profile). On the other hand, if you installed into the system default
location, you probably don't need to do anything. 

Also, some of the python scripts and the library modules use the `matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.sf.net>`_ library.  Matplotlib requires some other libraries
(e.g.  `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_), and if you don't have access to a
package management system (e.g. on Linux) which includes matplotlib and its
dependencies, you can get all at once by installing one of the python
distributions targeted at science, such as SAGE, Enthought Python Distribution,
or Python(x,y). Another solution if you already have python installed, is to
install matplotlib and other libraries via *easy_install* from setuptools (a
sort of package management system for python packages).


Interactive Usage
-----------------

The python modules are designed to be used from the interactive python prompt
as well, to provide a sort of MATLAB-like interactive environment where you can
manipulate coordinates stored in arrays, or plot data etc. For this, the
`IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/>`_ enhanced interactive environment is
recommended. Start with the matplotlib stuff preloaded with ``ipython -pylab``.
For those familiar with MATLAB, see `NumPy for MATLAB Users
<http://www.scipy.org/NumPy_for_Matlab_Users>`_ . After that, just import what
you need from the vasputil module and get going! See the python scripts for
reference, or ``pydoc vasputil``, ``pydoc vasputil.supercell`` etc. to read
documentation, or the ``?`` operator in IPython.
